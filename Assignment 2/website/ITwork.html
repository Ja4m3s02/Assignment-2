<p>The work of IT professionals is varied within the industry ranging from support roles to project management. To better understand what the day to day life of an IT professional looks like, I have conducted an interview with a relevant professional who works within the IT Project Management space. For this interview, Ata Sohrabi a Digital IT Project Manager at EHPlabs offered insight into his usual tasks and some of the challenges of his role. </p>
<p>Ata is in charge of all Digital projects at EHPlabs and the main priority of his role is end to end execution of digital products. These products include but are not limited to mobile apps, ecommerce solutions, ad hoc solutions and legacy system integrations and migration. He is also in charge of scoping out fresh projects that will assist the business’ growth and provide solutions to pain points. Once he identifies a pain point for the business he will map out a solution to the problem and this can take many forms. A recent example of this would be the migration of the brand’s ecommerce website from a tired legacy system, to an upgraded one which was Shopify in this case. He is not as involved in the development of these solutions, but rather the planning and execution of them. After being in the Industry for some years he has found that Project Management suits him better as opposed to the development of apps and programs directly. </p>
<p>Within Ata’s role, he interacts with the Senior Management of the Company and his two main team colleagues. His colleagues often work beside him everyday in constant communication as they work together to develop their solutions. Every week he has a meeting with his upline to discuss solutions that he has invented or to check in on the progress of current projects. Rarely, but when required, he will have a meeting with the CEO and CFO of his organization to get permission or funding for projects granted. He does not have any direct contact with consumers of the brand but his work does directly affect the experience of customers everyday. </p>
<p>Ata spends the majority of his time testing the various solutions that he has developed. A large chunk of this time revolves around creating reports of what he made with his team and planning ahead. There also is a fair amount of backlog grooming involved in this part of the role. When testing and creating reports isn’t taking his time then the next largest use of his time each week is planning. This includes the planning of future projects or the prioritisation/de-prioritization of features within current applications.</p>
<p>The most challenging part of the role is planning and future projections. With having no in house developers, Ata is forced to work with third party teams who are often in Europe or the US. This means that he doesn’t have much control over his project timelines, being at the mercy of these third party teams to deliver on time. This gets even trickier when one team gets delayed as it forces any other teams who are developing pieces of the project to stop their progress. This can push projects back weeks and sometimes even months. Ensuring that he finds the right team for the project is also a challenge each time a new solution is invented and development is needed. For his most recent project, Ata migrated EHPlabs’ legacy website onto a new platform. This entailed the migration and following maintenance of the database for the website along with some cloud engineering to make sure the development is up to standards. Although it is not part of his day to day role, he also personally did some coding and data management in this process too. </p>
<p>Ata’s role within EHPlabs’ is just one example of all the varied roles that the IT industry offers. Whether in Digital Project Management or development, it is clear that every role plays an important role and that a diverse interdependent team with unique specializations is required for an effective IT team</p>

<p><strong>Raw Transcript</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Digital project manager at EHP Holdings, what he does is end to end execution of a range of digital products. They vary from mobile apps to e comm solutions and ad hoc solutions, legacy integrations and systems we already have in place. In charge of scoping out fresh projects. Identify pain points and how new projects will alleviate pain points. Sometimes end users are customers of the brand that we solve pain points for. What is it and how do we solve those problems? In EHP he holds many hats not just IT but also product ideas. 
<li>The IT industry is a very broad industry that can start from infrastructure, you can work in networking or IT. You can work in databases or programming. A very wide range of skills all fall under IT. His IT experience comes from software dev and programming. He has a degree in electric engineering and IT. Found coding is not his core strength, not passionate about it. Found he is better at project managing for apps and development. Worked closely with business development analysts so he can direct developers in what they need to create and make solutions. 
<li>Sometimes he has to do some IT support role (system admin role) he also updates the website too. Or he will create an email too. Design from a product (mobile app) ready and so he will roll up his sleeves and do some of the design himself. Does some wireframing also. Black and white 
<li>He interacts with developers and the people who code the solutions. Make sure things are running on time and that they are on track. Sets goals for each 2 weeks of things that must be completed. UX/UI designers in terms of mobile app design’s Works with his colleague to plan out a roadmap for development and how they achieve the bigger picture together. Works with the coaching and CEX team the frontline of B2C. He gives the solutions to fix customers problems also and sometimes uplines it to the devs. 
<li>Does Not develop for clients or investors so much. Creates and interacts with the CEO and CFO to develop what they need. Have weekly project update calls with his upline to highlight successes and any problems they have. Also to highlight new project ideas with his upline and CEO/CFO are later on. We identify a problem for customers and then come up with a solution and get backing from the team to take it to the next step. 
<li>Sometimes testing products takes most of the time. Big chunk of it can be creating reports (what we made) or planning ahead. Backlog grooming. Priorities change time to time and checking in on features to be prioritised or deprioritized. Sometimes planning takes the most time
<li>Planning and projections for the future seem to be the most challenging. We don't have much in house developers and so more work on his plate. He also has less control over projects as they are 3rd party made so has to work by their timelines. Sometimes a delay from one part will affect all other parts. Sometimes there is no choice and a delay must be endured. 90 grand is standard for app development 
<li>One of the things that he did, we were on a legacy e com platform. The project was to migrate to a newer platform. Migrate the whole database and then maintain it. He also created a solution to the old legacy system. Was working with cloud engineering and making sure it is up to our standards. Coding of new programs and back end logic and data management.
