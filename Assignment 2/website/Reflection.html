<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p><strong>Don Vu</strong></p>
<p>Initially when Group 13 was formed we had some issues, team members leaving without notifying group, members finding other groups etc.… at one point there was only myself and Stefan left. Fortunately, the rest of the group found their way to us and we started our journey for this assignment. </p>
<p>The group was great to work with, we were respectful to one another, we were happy to assist and put our hands up to volunteer for parts in the assignment. Overall the progress was very positive.</p>
<p>The area I think we can improve on is meeting our agreed deadlines, even though this was not a major issue, we have had few weeks where we agreed to have something ready but some of us were not prepared. Then again this is what studying is about, its about learning to balance our commitments and school work and I think through the assignment our group has improved and able to communicate, plan and deliver within promised times. </p>

<p>I believe our group did a good job of dividing up the workload so that everyone felt as though they were contributing and no one felt as though they had done more than their fair share, this goes into another thing I believe went well which was our groups communication we were able to stay on top of our workload and kept each other in the loop on how we were travelling with our assigned parts.</p>
<p>I believe we could of benefited from reading the assignment more thoroughly as some parts were left until the last minute, as well as some people disappearing and leaving us guessing on how they were travelling if the missed a meeting.</p>
<p>I was surprised by how each member of the group was willing to pick up the slack if they noticed any and also were happy when they were assigned a task to just run with it.</p>
<p>I have learnt that although you may think you are communicating well it only takes one lapse in that communication for someone to lose faith.</p>
<p>I think our GitHub repository doesn’t reflect our groups work on the assignment as we gave two people the role of putting peoples parts into the github repository.</p>

<p>Team J has been a great group to work with and there has been great improvements in communication and teamwork as the project has progressed. What I believe we did well was the splitting of work between us and the weekly catch ups where we could express to each other how far along we are with our individual parts and any assistance we needed from the team. Everyone has been cordial with each other and keeping a respectful but relaxed attitude towards each other. What could be improved is the turning in of our respective assignment parts on time so that we were on track at an even faster rate, however this is a small problem that did not have a large overall effect. Something that surprised me about Team J was how well most of us worked together to achieve a common goal and how aligned our vision for the project was. Within our team I have learnt the importance of being present and ensuring that I communicate clearly in what I say to avoid misunderstandings. Overall Team J has been great to work with and more times than not we have accomplished what we set out to do and have done so effectively.</p>

<p>Team J has been an exceptional team to work with, and as a visitor from another country it has been even more interesting for myself. Even though I have worked with people from other countries back in the United States, this is the first time I have had the pleasure of working with a group of Australians in an educational setting. Through our work as a group and the class work in general, I have been given a small glimpse into group members daily lives. It nice to see that a lot of the daily grind is the same no matter where you live and what you do. At the beginning of the project things seemed a little strained, which is to be expected since none of us new each other. As our meeting progressed, discussions and conversation became more relaxed as we felt more at ease as a group. Communication between members is important as it enables project ideas to be expressed more freely, and every bodies thoughts, ideas and workload are better defined and integrated. When everyone in a group has a clear role, this leads to a smoother flow of ideas and you get more accomplished in a shorter time frame. There were some initial points of confusion about who was doing what and what the end goal should be, but this was quickly solved through open and constructive dialogue. There could have been improvements in keeping each other informed about what point we were at with our piece of the project, as this would have led to a more streamlined and faster process. Another minor problem was keeping other team members informed about whether they would be attending the group seasons. I am guilty of that myself. Overall, we seemed to work well as a group, meeting went well, problems were resolved quickly, we communicated effectively, and we completed the goal we set ourselves. It was a pleasure knowing a working with you</p>

<p>I believe that our team has worked really well together and communicated with each other to fill in on what an individual person has done and what needs to be done. We all have been on the same page for the majority of the time we have been as a group together and was able to touch base with everyone when we had our meetings. The work was distributed evenly and everyone volunteered to do something towards the assignment and focused on the parts we have had and worked to the best of our ability to produce good quality work and everyone managed to email each other our parts so that we all have a copy of that document. I have learnt a lot when it comes to this assignment and what people have said in meetings and email</p>
<p>I believe that we can improve on having a set due date for our parts of work and improve on our time management skills. It was not a major issue but it can be improved upon. We all could have read the assignment more thoroughly so that we can plan everything better and result in having more time to do our set tasks and have a clearer goal</p>

<h2>Group Reflection</h2>
<p>The group formed rather smoothly, with Don taking the lead and chairing the meetings the group quickly found its footing and divided up the assignment. Members were happy and cooperative with their assigned tasks and were willing to help each other and take on more work if required. </p>
<p>The groups time frames were laid out but met with loosely, as there was more time to complete each task. The important factor is the group never lost focus and was always present at meetings. If for some reason a member was not able to attend, they would notify the group and check in after the meeting to ensure nothing is missed. </p>
<p>Group work is difficult, not only we are working with people we’ve never worked with before but also, we don’t know much about the members. Team J overcame this issue in the first meeting where they introduced themselves to the group. This helps beak the ice and assist in getting some affinity development in the group. They then went and gave a brief history about their work, skills and knowledge – this helps the other members understand which area they may see others working in to demote their strengths. </p>
<p>Towards the end the group started to go astray in terms of communication and attendance. Considering majority of members have full-time jobs and families, it is understandable that everything may be too much at times. The group was very agile and quick to respond to issues and to formulate a backup plan in case a member decides to no longer participate in the activities. Fortunately, the backup plan was never in effect. We believe that until date, we as Group 13 a.k.a Team J, am proud and confident that our team has performed to the best of our ability and will continue to improve to work together more efficiently and effectively.  </p>
