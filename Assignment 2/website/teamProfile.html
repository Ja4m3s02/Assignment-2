Being given a computer with nothing on it led me to playing the default games loaded on it (pinball and solitaire) but there is only so much of those games you can play without being bored. This led me to messing around downloading stuff from the internet, and eventually getting a virus, this virus made my poor computer unusable, and I was too embarrassed to confess what I had done to my parents, so I learned how to reimage a computer, and that’s where my love for computers and problem solving started</td>
