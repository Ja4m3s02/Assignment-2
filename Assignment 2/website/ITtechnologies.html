<h2>Autonomus Vehicles</h2>
<p>There are currently around 40 companies working on autonomous vehicles including automotive heavyweights like Toyota, Audi and Honda as well as tech heavyweights like Tesla, Waymo and Comma. Ai , for the sake of simplicity we will be focusing on only two companies as who are taking different approaches to self-driving vehicles and are at different steps along the way. The Society of Automotive Engineers have released a 6 Level system for defining what level of automation a vehicle has. (SAE International Releases Updated Visual Chart for Its “Levels of Driving Automation” Standard for Self-Driving Vehicles, 2021) The levels are represented as a level 0 which is a vehicle that has 0 self-driving features and the driver is still in control of the vehicle and a level 5 is represented by human driving being completely eliminated and do not require human attention</p>
<p>We will start by talking about Tesla a company that many know as the “King” of electric and self-driving vehicles. In October of 2016 Tesla released an article stating that all of the cares produced will no have the hardware to enable level 5 autonomy although the software was not quite ready. (All Tesla Cars Being Produced Now Have Full Self-Driving Hardware, 2016) In the article they state that they will further calibrate their self-driving system by using millions of miles of real-world driving experience taken from the users. Currently they are at level 4 on the SAE Rating system however Elon Musk CEO of Tesla Motors believes that they are very close to level five autonomy and believed that they would have the basic functionality of level 5 autonomy by the end of 2020 and that there are no fundamental challenges left of reaching that level (Elon Musk 2020, 1:00). Some of the Hardware developments that were required for level 5 autonomy were the development and improvement of Tensor processing units (TPU) which are designed to make neural net training and predictions a magnitude faster. The way Autonomous vehicles use deep neural Networks (dnn) is by feeding the neural network information from various sensors which are fed through a neural network to make sense of the environment and then create a decision on how the car should behave. </p>
<p>The second company I will be talking about is Waymo which began as googles self-driving car project in 2009 its mission statement is to make it safe and easy for people and things to get where they’re going. Currently waymo believes that they are at level 4 autonomy meaning that no human driver is necessary in there defined operational conditions (Waymo 2021) . Waymo works by first going into a new area or city and maps the area including details like stop signs and cross walks and then instead of relying on data such as a gps it uses its detailed maps and sensor data to determine its current location. Waymo currently has two services a Ride Hailing Service and a Truck service. Some of the Sensors that Waymo uses to feed data to its custom neural networks are Lidar, Cameras and radar. As well as many backup systems a secondary computer and backup collision detection systems in case the primary systems fail. One of the problems that waymo currently has is that they rely on their detailed maps so as you start mapping bigger areas this turns into a large challenge. Waymo are also using a TPU after partnering with google brain to train their Machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>The development of autonomous vehicles will has the potential to have large impacts on many industries and the general public. In a study by the university of Michigan they believe that the number of vehicles owned per household could reduce up to 43 % (SCHOETTLE and SIVAK, 2015) This reduction in vehicles could have large impacts on the automotive industry as the number of vehicles needed to service the population would be reduced due to return home features of self-driving vehicles. Another potential impact is on industries like mining where autonomous vehicles (avs) can operate in areas that are high risk by taking out the drivers which will increase worker safety and productivity this however also will displace many people who work in industries that rely on someone controlling a vehicle, This will also effect industries like farming, truck driving and ride sharing services or taxi companies that can rely on AVs to do the job instead of human operators. The people who will be most effected are the people who work in these industries as the US department of commerce believes that 15.5 million U.S workers are employed in occupations that could be affected by the introduction of AVs (The Employment Impact of Autonomous Vehicles, 2017) there are also some new jobs being created from the development of AVs, an example is at Waymo when one of their AVs comes up to a situation that it doesn’t know how to deal with it will send the information out to a human who then makes the decision on how the car should proceed this happens when an unusual occurrence happens such as road work or a police officer directing traffic.</p>
<p>As AVs continue to develop and become more available my life and the life of my friends and family will be affected in a multitude of ways. One of the ways it will affect me is by the large displacement of the work force who will lose their jobs to AVs these people will need to find new jobs and careers and will increase the amount of competition for various careers, a number of new jobs will also be available which could impact which career I end up in the future. Another positive way it could affect me and my friends is the possibility of longer commutes to work being less time consuming as you will be able to do other things while you drive, such as catching up on sleep or reading. This will make jobs in areas outside of where I currently deem an acceptable commute to become more attractive opening up the number of jobs I can target.</p>
<p>Some of my Family members are elderly so AVs could change their lives dramatically as they are losing confidence driving some of them are stuck to public transport and being from a rural town that dramatically increases the times that they can travel to the places they want to go and will reduce the time that it takes them to travel to places. As with AVs they may not even need to have a licence to be able to drive a car. This will also impact people with disabilities who aren’t able to drive and have to rely on taxis or public transport, while I was working one day a lady came in who could no longer drive and she had to cancel her appoint 2 times due to no taxis being available nearby to take her to her appointment, I’m sure if you asked her what she thought about a car that she could own that would be able to drive itself she would be over the moon.</p>

<h2>Cloud Computing</h2>
<p>Cloud computing is one of the buzz words in today technical jargon, as indeed it should be, as the capabilities of cloud computing are endless. Most people think that cloud computing is a relativity new concept dating back the last 10 to 15 years, but this is not the case. Let us take a brief look at the history of cloud computing. Since the 1950s, due to the prohibitive costs of mainframes and computers organizations have been using a more complex and everchanging ideas to process their data. To do this they implemented the idea of time sharing, where several users could access the mainframe from there dumb terminals (terminals with no processing power) and utilizing the maximum efficiency of the mainframe. Sharing the power of the mainframe by many remote users was the foundation of the cloud computing. The idea of sharing resources continued throughout the fifties until the 60’s when an American computer scientist named J.C.R. Licklider came up with an idea for an interconnected system of computers. The idea of interconnected computer systems was taken up by a division of the American military called The Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency. </p>
<p>DARPA was asked by the US Government to create a network of connected computers that could talk to each other and keep government departments connected in the case of nuclear war. This revolutionary idea helped Bob Taylor and Larry Roberts develop something known as ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network). This was mainly a series of connected computers located at the department of defence and several Universities such as Cal Tech and Berkley. The internet or ARPA net grew into a worldwide network of computers spanning the globe, giving everyone cheap access to processing power and Web. This has led to the development of the cloud and the services it provides. There are three types of cloud types, Public Cloud which is owned and managed by a combination of businesses, universities, government organizations and their services are shared among multiple customers. Private Cloud, where the cloud service is not shared with any other organization and Hybrid cloud which refers to a mixed computing, storage, and services environment comprised of on-premises infrastructure, private cloud services, and a public cloud. There are several major Cloud providers today, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform to name the biggest of the cloud companies. In this article will discuss AWS or Amazon Web Services, since it is not only the biggest but also considered to be the forerunner of cloud services. So, what does this all mean for businesses, organizations in general. Cloud providers such as AWS basically provide on demand delivery of IT resources a service in that they basically provide the hardware, software, data storage, databases and networking to companies or institutions to use for a price, of (charged as per instance) when you use the services. </p>
<p>This in turn means that companies do not have to buy physical data centres and servers, networking, data storage, data processing, computing power and software licences. Nor do they have to worry about the upkeep of these systems or hiring people with technical expertise, AWS can provide all this and more as a complex ever evolving infrastructure in 3 major services categories, infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and packaged software as a service (SaaS). We will touch briefly on each one as well as the other services Amazon offers.Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), is basically what it says, you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other data centre infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. In addition, it quickly scales up or down rapidly meeting your organizations needs and you only pay for what you need. Its basically the foundation for the other service. Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) is a service that delivers a platform to clients, enabling them to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build and maintain the infrastructure such software development processes typically require. Software as a Service (SaaS) is a cloud service where instead of downloading software to your desktop or business network to run and update, you instead access a wide range of software applications, business application, communication applications via an internet. SaaS offers lower upfront costs than traditional software downloads and installation, making them more available to a wider range of businesses, and the advantages this brings. Since it runs through a browser you do not have to worry about hardware and software compatibility, patching, upgrades and maintenance. AWS Elastic Beanstalk offering is an easy-to-use service for you to deploy web applications and services developed with Java, .NET, PHP, Python, Ruby, on familiar webservers servers such as Apache and Nginx. </p>
<p>You can simply upload your code from a Git repository and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the deployment, provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling to application health monitoring. At the same time, you retain full control over the AWS resources powering your application. These are just some of the services AWS offers, there are many more, block chain, compute, web hosting, IOT (internet of things), databases, game development, Quantum Computing and Technologies. This is a rapidly developing field, with many advances being developed every day. As you can see cloud services depends a lot on network infrastructure, bandwidth and download and upload speeds are critical. Advances in wireless such as 5G and greater are critical to cloud services, as are advances in the speeds of the physical servers in the Data Centres that so much of this relies on. The faster the servers and support equipment is the faster everything will work. The processing power of Quantum Computers being developed by Google and others well offer great leaps forward in the quality and speed of service. The advances made in artificial intelligence will play a major role in creating new algorithms that can improve on cloud throughput, load balancing and sequencing. The affects of cloud services are many and will eventually affect all aspects of business and industry. It is reshaping technology. Companies no longer have to purchase expensive hardware or maintain in house systems they can simply buy time on AWS, they no longer have the cost and overhead of application development, it can all be deployed in the cloud. Companies can move so much of there services online, banks being a prime example. I use several online banks, that have no physical stores. Development and design of manufactured items can be moved to the cloud using Cloud compute and machine learning as can supply chain. </p>
<p>Media, human resources and government departments and functions can all be replaced by cloud services. This is going to affect people’s jobs, companies are not going to need as many IT staff, companies that can move a lot or all their services to the cloud and online will downsize and reduce physical staff, less office space to be leased, assembly line workers can be replaced by robots run from the cloud, driverless cars and delivery trucks. Cloud companies such as Sales Force or SAP can take over all a company’s services such as accounting, pay role and many others. On the other end of the spectrum researchers, engineers, scientists will be in demand developing the next cutting-edge technology as cloud services continue changing and evolving. A simple example of how cloud architecture can change a whole business model is Amazon online shopping. It not really a matter of what cloud technologies will change, its more a matter of what it will not change. The cloud affects my life in multiple ways, just about everything I do involves the cloud in some way or another. I am writing this article on Office 360 a cloud-based app, it stored on a cloud server, I am accessing it through a cloud-based web browser. I bank online, I use a cloud-based map to get around, I do all my shopping online, my movies and my music are from a cloud-based service. I administer Linux servers located on a cloud somewhere in the world. Everyone, my friends, colleagues, family all utilize a cloud-based service at some point during the day, we communicate through SMS, WhatsApp, WeChat. The only way to avoid this would be to disconnect from the internet and live in the woods. Even then I am not sure if that is possible. As technology progresses and the internet and cloud services become cheaper and faster and more sophisticated everything will be connected to the cloud and everyone will utilize some form of cloud-based service. It will no longer be a cloud more like a hive mind. </p>

<h2>Blackchain and Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p><strong>What is BlockChain and Cryptocurrency?</strong></p>
<p>Block chain and Cryptocurrency are both disruptive technologies that seek to instils more democracy in both the internet and financial world. Block chain technology in its current state of the art is a decentralised and distributed financial ledger built on a peer-to-peer system that is openly shared and creates an immutable record of transactions that are timestamps. Each of these transactions is called a block. At its current developmental stage financial institutions are utilising it the most.  This is due to some important key factors, first of these being its best-known associated technology Bitcoin and secondly, the flaws in the traditional financial system that were highlighted during the 2008 financial crisis (Nofer, Gomber, Hinz and Schiereck, 2017). Block chain along with cryptocurrency signals a transitory shift of power from a monarchical system, to a peer-to-peer system (Pepe, 2018), As stated by Antonopoulos, these technologies represent “a shift from trusting people to trusting math” as faith in human ledgers and institutions is no longer required (Antonopoulos, 2021).</p>
<p><strong>Positives and Negatives</strong></p>
<p>The distributed ledger system that BlockChain technology enables, offers both benefits and negatives. When compared to the existing centralised systems, where ledgers require human intervention, the networks of Cryptocurrency do not break down even In the case of some node failures. Essentially the network always has a backup and cannot be switched off. As a result, trust in this technology is raised when an individual no longer has to assess the trustworthiness of the network or its participants. The removal of middle men in this process helps to also further data security as a whole with data being spread over a network not stored in a singular space. As discussed in a recent MIT paper, there is no conceivable method of governance over user’s digital identities that is centralised due to the backlash a move such as this would incur. However Block chain offers the opportunity to award everyone digital identities that are globally recognised and borderless without the need for centralised institutions to store this information. A current example of this system is ShoCard which is a globally verifiable identity that can be trusted by governments and banks alike. However, the platform for ShoCard is built of a public block chain layer, so that no one company is storing this important information while also being encrypted so as to not be tampered with (Shrier, Wu and Pentland, 2016). </p>
<p>In contrast to some of these positives exist some problematic negatives. Block chain, much like money is a neutral resource, it can be used for both positive and negative effects. As discussed by Voshmgir in her 2018 TED talk, we may design a machine that works against us, posing the question of governance over BlockChain. The code that the system is based upon sets the limitations of what is possible, meaning that governance experts must also be involved in the development of this cutting edge technology. Voshmgir insists that the incentives of this new technology must be chosen carefully, recognising that the current bitcoin model is plutocratic, incentivising those who already have wealth in the real world can also dominate cryptocurrency(Voshmgir, 2018). If the anonymity of the technologies associated with crypto technologies are not certain, then back doors could be opened leading to manipulation of these technologies into social scoring systems like those recently implemented in China. </p>
<p>At the moment, BlockChain is still in its infancy, like the internet was during the 90’s, however the promise of this technology is already being seen. (Pepe, 2018)  These technologies have not has their desired impact yet as “block chain created a huge ‘pause’ in decision-making as organizations generally appreciate its transformational capability, but were unclear about next steps” as according to Louden Owen, CEO of DLT Labs, a Toronto based block chain development enterprise (Ismail, 2021). As for the future of this technology K.Schlapkohl of IBM predicts that  as “Pragmatic governance models will emerge”, Central Banks will take one step closer to embracing this technology (Schlapkohl, 2020).</p>
<p><strong>Impact of BlockChain Technologies</strong></p>
<p>BlockChain technology is already making quick ground within core industries in terms of attention and in some cases piloting of test programs. In 2019 Deloitte’s industry report  found that 53% of respondents acknowledged that Blockchain has become a critical priority for their business, and 83 percent see worth in Blockchain implementation (Deloitte, 2017). </p>
<p>This adoption of BlockChain will see impacts across multiple industries. One of the most concerned industries would have to be the Financial Industry. Blockchain will implement a new book keeping ledger system that is immutable and verified by the system itself for payments. This will automate the process that is currently performed by banks and auditors (Holotiuk, Pisani and Moormann, 2019). With Blockchain the need for reconciliation or separately stored information will be replaced with a unique single version of the truth, with every piece of information within its ledger being time stamped and assigned an owner. The possible consequences for Financial Institutions will be disastrous if this technology goes mainstream as by nature it is more secure, instant in every case and more private (Aste, Tasca and Di Matteo, 2017).</p>
<p>The implementation of this technology is already being utilised to certify documents and belongings. Even the diamond industry has begun implementing Blockchain to certify their assets authenticity and to provide proof of existence via the timestamp. This proof is immutable and thus generates buyer’s trust.</p>
<p>Perhaps one of the most revolutionary ideas that Blockchain presents is Decentralised Corporations and Governance. In its current form, society is centralised and institutions exist to govern our socio economic communities. Blockchain transfers the ownership of access and sharing from these technology hierarchies into non-hierarchical governance spread to the edges of the network. Decision making will be made across users in the network rather than being handed down and controlled from the centre (Aste, Tasca and Di Matteo, 2017). </p>
<p><strong>Effect of Blockchain on Daily Life</strong></p>
<p>The impacts of this technology on daily life will extend past only financial institutions but also into public sectors such as voting and personal identification.</p>
<p>The possibility of a borderless, digital identity is what makes all prior advancements possible. Blockchain technology can securely track digital identities much more efficiently assuring the validity of digital identities. This would mean for myself that my identity used in areas of life such as banking, citizenship and employment will be stored securely within BlockChain. Combined this identity with cryptocurrency, and monetary transfers to international family members would be secure and instant. While also eliminating the need to convert to local currency (Hughes et al., 2019).</p>
<p>The decentralisation of the internet will result in a macro level change in society. With the rise of tech giants such as Facebook and Google, the internet has quickly become more hierarchical than intended. Blockchain offers a change of structure from servers controlled by global corporations to a P2P network. With websites running off multiple nodes, certain websites or the internet itself will no longer be censored by governments or corporations. This will also enhance my personal privacy on the internet, with data being stored and spread across the network rather than all stored in one location (Zarrin, Hao Wen and Babu-Saheer, 2020).</p>
<p>My personal Cloud Storage will also be positively affected with the distribution of data across the network rather than stored in a single server, making my data more secure.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of where Blockchain and Cryptocurrency will affect my personal day to day life. Blockchain is a revolution within itself for the internet and as such positions itself as one of humanity’s greatest inventions with unlimited real life applications.</p>


<br />

<h2>Robots</h2>
<p><strong>What does it do?</strong><p>
<p>Robots are becoming more viable and easier to build now than it has been in the past. The current state of robots now, I say it is still in development. We can build and program robots to perform certain actions but not have their own free will. Even in japan they have been using robots to help people in their daily lives for either entertainment or to help perform certain actions. Robots still have a long way to go before they are finished and be able to create a new form of society but yet it is going to be integrated into our lives soon.</p>
<p>Robots are able to do some things that humans can do. For example, walking, grab, sense, tedium, perfect objective recall. Just to name a few. These are just some of the things that robots can do now and some of the actions they can do is significantly better than what humans can do. They have force multipliers, have a better focus and like I said earlier being able to perform a perfect, objective recall. There are even robots who can do our jobs better than us and perform the task at a faster rate with either the same consistency or even a little inconsistency throughout perform certain tasks.</p>
<p>I believe robots will be able to do almost the same number of tasks that humans that does not involve cooking. What robots are doing now is incredible alone but yet when it comes to the next 3 years. They will be able to do more tasks and a better quality of work. The improvement from now to 3 years into the future may not seem that significant but now in our day and age. The fact that robots will be able to do even more things than what they can already do. Having robots being more advanced, they will be more than likely be able to have some sort of more improved AI features that can help identify and solve problems and be more expensive to build.</p>
<p>Forms of technological equipment’s that we have that can build a robot are equipment from electrical engineering, information engineering just to name a few. The technological equipment that is used in all of the fields are advanced enough that can precisely build a robot that can function on its own and make its own decision based on what the robot has been programmed to do. Electrical engineering allows the electrical current to flow throughout the entire build and securely able to boot up, shut down and run actively to make the robot to do what it has to do. Electrical engineers have a major role when it comes to making the robot even possible. Without an electrical engineer, the robot will have no form of electrical current to make the robot unified and able to turn on when needed to. Information engineering allows the robot to be able to gain information, retain said information and act upon the information given. They also create the operating system that the robot needs to be even able to run. Without an information engineer, the robot will not be able to do anything. The robot will just stay still and not comprehend any of the information that anything external tries to give to it. </p>
<p><strong>What is the likely impact?</strong></p>
<p>Potential impacts of the development of robots are the required equipment to create the robot. As the equipment are being bought. The price of each part might increase because of how many tests and experiments when researching and building a robot. The project to make a robot is expensive as it is already. The price of parts might increase because of having to buy so many parts and a shortage of parts to build the robot. This is just one potential impact of the development of robots.</p>
<p>One thing that will definitely change is how people will become lazier. If robots become a universal product and is easily accessible. People will want to have these robots to do things for them so that they do not have to do the tasks they do not want to do. This will create a society that will have people being lazy and robots doing tasks that has been given to them that humans should be doing. For example, people might not want to cook after a long day at work and have the robot cook for them. By doing this, it will create a psychological difference between them cooking and getting the satisfaction of it and just being lazy and having someone else do it.</p>
<p>The people that are in the high positions of a company is who I believe will be affected the most. This is because they will be doing so many tasks to complete and might need help from a robot to complete them all. This will allow them to complete all tasks that they need to be done and still have time to spend with friends and family. For example, a CEO of a company will have a lot of tasks to do on a day-to-day basis and might require a robot to help him complete his tasks. The robot could go deliver a package by 10am while the CEO needs to be in a meeting at 10:15am and he will be late if he delivers the package. This will allow busy people to complete more tasks more efficiently and be more productive when doing so.</p>
<p>Having robots might be able to create new jobs and make other current jobs redundant. This is because that robots will be able to do the jobs and do it better with more consistency making some jobs completely redundant and people will lose jobs because of it but yet it will create jobs to help maintain the robots and make sure the robots are up to date and have no errors. Also, people need to build these robots in the first place. For example, when assembling a car. There used to be a lot more people to put all the parts together. Now there are robots that can do all the heavy lifting and not have to injure anyone. This also comes with a job of robot maintenance. By having robots will create new jobs and make current jobs and/or technologies redundant in certain fields</p>
<p><strong>How will this affect you? </strong><p>
<p>Having robots in our daily lives can help people do some things in their daily lives. For example, having a robot that can reach and grab objects for people who are unable to grab the desired object. The robot allows people to what they would like to have to then do what they want to do in the first place. By having a robot that can reach out and grab things significantly help people for their daily lives</p>
<p>Having a robot will definitely help me in my life. It will affect me because it will allow me to have a robot to reach areas that I might be unable to reach, like I said earlier and be able to hold things for me when I have my hands full. I tend to sometimes have my hands busy doing when one but I need to have another object be hanging up in a certain position and by having a robot. It will allow me to do exactly that.</p>
<p>A robot will dramatically change my life. I will definitely become lazier and use the robot to help do things that I normally can do myself. This is because I would use the robot to do the things that I do not want to do and I do the things I want to do. Making me be lazier and have no home ethics to do anything.</p>
<p>Having robots will definitely affect my friends and family. My friends and family would use the robot but not that often which will change their lives and creates some positive and negative habits between all of us. This is because that my friends and family might only want to hang out with me because of the robot and what it does. Yeah, having friends and family spend time with you is great and creates a stronger connection with them but it also can create a negative relationship with friends and family because they could only be with you because of the robot. It really depends on the people and the robot itself</p>
