<p><strong>Jordan Uhe's Ideal Job</strong></p>
<p>Cloud Operations Manager</p>
<p>A description of the position</p>
<p>This position involves managing cloud services infrastructure and integrating it into existing ICT services. It also involves making plans on how cloud systems would be operating, designs and implemented as well as making sure the servers follow security regulations.</p>
<p>There is also some troubleshooting of hybrid cloud environments which can be mission critical.</p>
<p>I have always found Complex systems fun to try and simplify and fix, which means a mess of cloud servers would be a challenge which I might find fun. I aspire to be a manager of a department or at least high in the chain of command, so a manager position is appealing.</p>
<p>skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position</p>
<p>Experience and skills in cloud operations, server Management, user privileges, computer use monitoring, and systems automation.</p>
<p>Excellent communication and negotiation skills, with the ability to simplify complex ideas so that laymen can understand</p>
<p>Ability to think about and imagine different possibilities and transform them into a reality which can be produced by other people</p>
<p>The ability to work around strict conditions such as limited resources</p>
<p>Able to negotiate and communicate effectively with clients and contractors</p>
